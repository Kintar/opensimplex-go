OpenSimplex in Go
-----------------

This is based on Kurt Spencer's OpenSimplexNoise, and largely copied from his
Java version here: https://gist.github.com/KdotJPG/b1270127455a94ac5d19

I've included tests, which verify that the output matches the Java version
exactly. I haven't run these tests on multiple OSs or architectures, however.

This code is under the same "license" as Kurt's OpenSimplex - the public domain

Next Steps
==========
Benchmarking would allow some work to be done on performance. If performance
problems come up, that'll be the first step.
